`YAPE' MODULES
    The `YAPE' hierarchy of modules is an attempt at a unified means
    of parsing and extracting content. It attempts to maintain a
    generic interface, to promote simplicity and reusability. The
    API is powerful, yet simple. The modules do tokenization (which
    can be intercepted) and build trees, so that extraction of
    specific nodes is doable.

DESCRIPTION
    This module merely sub-classes `YAPE::Regex', and produces a
    rather verbose explanation of a regex, suitable for
    demonstration and tutorial purposes.
